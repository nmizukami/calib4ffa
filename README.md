The notebooks generate figures used in the paper "On the choice of calibration metrics for “high flow” estimation using
hydrologic models" submitted to HESS.  Data does not exist here.

1. ffa.ipynb:  Analysis on error in the performance metrics for each calibration case - VIC and mHM with 5 calibration metrics (Figure 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6) 

2. ffa_flow_residual-analysis.ipynb: Analysis on residuals of the calibrated modeled flows (Figure 7)

3. ffa_flow_metrics_ensemble.ipynb: Analysis on error in the performance metrics from ensemble of residual re-introduced flows (stochastic error generation method is based on Farmer and Vogel 2016)

4. ffa_flow_uncertainty_FV2016.ipynb:  Test stochastic error generation method used in Farmer and Vogel 2016
